      <h1>Hi, I am Seyeong Park!</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>Welcome to here to hear my story!</p>
      <br/>
      <p>As a software engineer, I like to implement new features and enjoy coding. When I fix the errors, it can't be explained how I feel a huge accomplishment! It's not enough dancing. I think this is one of the biggest reasons why I want to be a software developer and to keep learning new skills.</p>

      <p>I chose CS as my major because I've been a curious and creative person about everything in life. Whenever I use a mobile application or dynamic object, I've been always curious about how it is working and I searched for and understand my curiosity. I can say this is another reason why I want to be a software developer! I had been writing down notes whenever I up with great ideas. Every time studying programming and researching IT trends, it was being more clear how I can implement ideas into real apps. My goal is to implement all my application ideas in my life.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Let me tell you what I do during my free time.</p>
      <p>My first interest is "Bicycling". It's been a quite long time since to ride a bicycle. As far as I remember, it's been over 15 years! I love the fresh breeze on my face and the speed, and it makes me get anywhere! So when I want to freshen my mind or it is nice weather, I use to go out on my bike.</p>

      <p>My second one is "Photography". When I was 14, my phone camera was broken and I told this my father. I thought he will buy a new phone for me, but he present me a DSLR camera. It was my start being interested in photography. As a 14 girl, the camera looked so professional and cool than anything. From 14 to now, I took pictures of my family, friends, landscapes, and my life. Now, I am called a 'professional photographer'. Sometimes, I do volunteer work as a photographer. Whenever I show my photos to people and they feel happy, I feel happy than anything! I want to be a photographer who makes others feel happy other.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>My last interest is "Playing Basketball". When I was 10, I was part of a basketball club at the elementary school. It was not a professional, but it was enough to start as a hobby. Either shooting a goal or missing a ball, I just like handling a basketball and being on a basketball field. And.. it looks cool, isn't it?</p>

      <p>What about you? Could you tell me your story?</p>
